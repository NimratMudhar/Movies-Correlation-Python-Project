## Introduction

This project focuses on understanding the relationships between different variables in a movies dataset. By conducting a thorough analysis and visualization of the data, we aim to answer questions such as:
- How does the budget of a movie correlate with its revenue?
- Are certain genres more popular among different age groups?
- Do user ratings have any influence on a movie's performance?

By exploring these questions, we hope to gain insights into the movie industry and the preferences of audiences.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies). It contains a comprehensive collection of movies with various attributes, such as:
- Title
- Release Year
- Genre
- Budget
- Revenue
- User Ratings
- Cast and Crew
- and more...

The dataset is provided in a CSV format and can be easily imported for analysis.

## Tools Used

The following tools were used in this project:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## Analysis Steps

Data Loading: Load the dataset from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.<br>
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, data formatting, and outliers.<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform initial exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.<br>
Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients between various attributes to identify potential correlations.<br>
Visualization: Create informative visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps) to illustrate relationships and trends.<br>
Hypothesis Testing: Formulate and test hypotheses to validate or reject assumptions about the data.<br>
Interpretation: Provide insights and conclusions based on the analysis results.

## Results

The results of the analysis are presented in the form of visualizations, correlation coefficients, and summaries. These results provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between different attributes of movies and offer insights into the factors that contribute to a movie's success.
